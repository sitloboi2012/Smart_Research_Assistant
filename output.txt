Virtual Reality (VR) Advertising Communication Design Based on 3D Wireless Active Visual Sensing
With the vigorous development of the advertising industry, advertising in the era of intelligent media fills all aspects of our lives, and more and more intelligent media are applied to the advertising industry. The current three-dimensional advertising and interactive advertising are too fragmented in form, with three-dimensional advertising having a strong sense of three-dimensionality but lacking interactivity and interactive advertising having strong interactivity but lacking visual attraction. How to integrate 3D advertising and interactive advertising in order to make advertising in the future has greater development potential and market, whether in the visual or interactive experience can attract the target consumers becomes very necessary. It is found that VR technology has a wide range of application prospects, and intelligent media advertising mediated by VR technology follows the trend of advertising industry development. This thesis uses VR (virtual reality) technology as a medium to study the integration of 3D advertising and interactive advertising in the smart media era. In the second phase, the development direction of VR as an advertising medium in the era of intelligent media is identified. The research on the integration of 3D animated ads and interactive ads under VR technology is launched, and the research on 3D stereoscopic and interactive design of advertisements in the era of smart media is a reflection and exploration of the future language of advertising design. And through the comparison with traditional advertising, it is concluded that the aesthetic subject of VR advertising is “polycentric,” the aesthetic object. Then, we analyze the theoretical roots of the formation of the aesthetic characteristics of VR advertising from three levels: media technology, communication theory, and audience psychology. Finally, we return to the general environment of visual culture and explore the deconstruction of visual culture by the aesthetic characteristics of VR advertising in three levels: “symbol collapse,” “audience reshaping,” and “immersive communication.”

The “Mixed” Reality of Virtual Brand Endorsers: Understanding the Effect of Brand Engagement and Social Cues on Technological Perceptions and Advertising Effectiveness
Abstract Within the context of virtual human influencers, the current study adds to the growing literature examining the impact of a social media–based mix of reality and virtuality on perceived anthropomorphism and authenticity, in addition to the subsequent effects on advertising perceptions and implicit behavior. Through an experimental design with 242 participants, data suggest that while some elements of realism and product engagement levels do increase anthropomorphic and authenticity perceptions, the effects significantly attenuate when the virtual influencer is engaging with too much reality in a single social media post, such as consuming a real-world branded product with a real human. Further, data suggest that presenting virtual influencers within a “mixed” reality social media–based environment can lead to implicit product selection through endorser and brand credibility and attitude toward the brand.

The study of how XR technologies impact the retail industry, now and in the future
Extended reality (XR) is currently one of the most discussed technologies in the retail sector. While XR applications are presently utilized by a range of retail companies, recent technological developments and societal transformations indicate that these technologies will become a mainstream necessity for success. This paper investigates how XR technologies impact the retail sector, now and in the future. In order to collect substantiated and timely data, this study engages in a multi faceted, qualitative data collection approach including a literature review, attendance at retail conferences and events, and semi-structured interviews with industry experts. Results reveal the implementation of three types of XR technologies are significant contributors to company success: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). They are currently utilized to enhance the customer experience, improve training, conduct consumer behavioral analyses, and develop prototyping for increased efficiency and productivity in product merchandising, packaging and branding. However, implementation of these technologies does not guarantee success. This study indicates success of these applications requires an understanding of each technology’s specific affordances in order to effectively integrate them within particular areas of the retail supply chain. Augmented reality is often best suited for consumer applications, while necessary proprietary equipment makes virtual and mixed reality more effective for industrial and enterprise applications. If utilized effectively, these technologies can help increase sales, make the manufacturing workflow more cost effective and efficient, and create a retail landscape that allows for the synchronous success of both brick and mortar stores and ecommerce. Future XR technologies will look to standardize and simplify, and eventually, there will be a collection of uniform XR experiences that will become conventional, easily integrated, and user friendly. If retailers want to be competitive, both in online and offline shopping, this study emphasizes the need to invest in XR technologies and build flexible tech management teams that prioritize XR as a technological resource, and restructure businesses to easily adapt to the rapidly changing tech landscape.

Immersive Technologies in Adult Learning as an Innovative Marketing Tool in the Educational Market
The article reviews the economic organization and effectiveness of adult education using virtual reality technologies. The main driver of the development of the immersive learning market is the demand from corporations. It is still expensive for most schools and universities, but companies, on the contrary, see it as a way to reduce costs. Immersive learning is a method that uses an artificial or simulated environment that allows students to become fully immersed in the learning process. In addition to creating a distraction-free environment, it can break the monotony of learning and development through stimulating visuals. Immersive learning can make learning more productive and valuable by increasing student engagement. The article also considers the factors that make immersive technologies an innovative tool for use in the marketing strategies of educational institutions and for the promotion of educational content. Immersive learning is a dynamic strategy that can improve e-learning and revolutionize the world of education. This method has great potential to lead the future of learning and help achieve its important goals. VR training is especially in demand in industries with a high line staff turnover: it reduces the cost of continuous training of new employees. Their business applications are almost limitless, from order picking and surgical operations to digital twins to modelling and tracking manufacturing plants, supply chains and other complex systems. AR and VR significantly increase the value and convenience that these opportunities create. These technologies improve how users visualize and access all new monitoring data, how they receive and follow instructions and product manuals, and how they interact. It was concluded that with immersive technologies in educational marketing, the educational market would develop, increase and change under the influence of innovations. It is also believed that the money spent on such technologies is not considered an expense but an investment in the development of the company and the person.

Multimodal Human Systems Exploration with Tangible XR for the Internet of Production: An expert survey
Agile product development makes it possible to react flexibly to changing customer requirements. In this context, user and expert assessments, explorations and tests are very important, since customer requirements can often be easier identified by testing a first product or a prototype. Due to complex and long development processes, the development of prototypes is often time-consuming and costly. To improve this, we are developing a method in which the use of mixed reality (XR) allows certain product functionalities to be explored at a very early stage by using multimodal virtual prototypes. Traditional virtual reality (VR) addresses only the visual and acoustic modalities and is limited in its immersion, which is especially impeding for products where physical interaction and haptic experience is an important part of the product functionalities. Based on the findings of the multiple resources theory, Tangible XR allows part of this haptic experience to be experienced and integrated with the virtual experience, so that change requests to the product based on user or expert assessments can be identified and implemented at an early stage of the development process of socio-technical systems. In addition to this retrospective user assessment, Tangible XR can also be used to prospectively explore and develop product functionalities in an exploratory manner together with stakeholders. This exploratory paradigm can be an essential component of agile processes. The explorative approach developed is presented by using a Tangible XR car door opening mechanism as a demonstrator. Based on an expert study, a first proof of concept is presented.

Boosting Business With Machine Learning-Based Automated Visual Data Processing: Results of Finnish Company Interviews
Machine Learning (ML) solutions are rapidly evolving and are increasingly capable of performing Automated Visual Data Processing (AVDP) tasks such as visual scene understanding, 3D model reconstruction and automated content generation tasks. We believe that novel AVDP solutions can significantly boost a company’s business, streamline the creation of 3D content and models, enable adaptation of content in XR applications and support the creation of digital twins for a company’s needs. However, there are also obstacles that limit the business use of such solutions. The objective of our research is to study the skills and insights of companies in using different kinds of AVDP solutions in their business. This article presents the results of interviews with 10 Finnish companies. The interviews comprised three sections: The first section gave a brief introduction about the existing AVDP solutions for the respondents. The second section collected information on the respondents’ background and the respective company’s experience of using ML in business and its short and long-term interest in developing or using different AVDP solutions in its business. The third section comprised thematic interviews which covered visual data processing themes that the respondents selected to be of interest to their company’s business.

Overview of Immersive Technology: Terminology, State of the Art, and APL Efforts
Immersive technologies have roots dating back to the 1800s. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) has been exploring how to use these technologies to meet critical national needs for decades. Today these technologies constitute an entire domain, replete with its own lexicon, and commercially available tools have become more capable and less expensive. There are use cases for immersive technologies in just about every field, from the entertainment industry to health care to defense. This article reviews the history of immersive technologies, clarifies some of the terminology used to describe the technologies, and presents the current state of the art. It then presents 15 examples of APL work in a wide range of application areas including intelligence, military, first responders, medical, space, human factors, education, and research, and it concludes with some additional use cases. broad spectrum of hardware, software, capabilities, and uses. For example, the entertainment industry, an early adopter, has flooded the market with immersive games. Other industries, from health care to military and law enforcement to architecture, are catching on, using immersive technology and experiences to interact with their communities, to train their personnel,5 and to visualize complex designs, to name just a few uses. APL has been engaged in immersive technology for more than two decades. As the domain grows and technologies advance, APL staff members working in many disciplines are developing and testing innovative immersive applications that support the missions of Lab sponsors and the nation. We begin this article by defining the various terms used in the industry and in this issue of the Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest. Next we present a brief history INTRODUCTION Immersive displays have a long history. The first entrée into immersive displays hearkens back to 1838, with the invention of the Wheatstone stereoscope that presented users a 3-D perspective relying on still images.1 Advances in computing power and data availability led to augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the 1960s.2 By the late 20th century, the US Air Force had made significant developments in AR with heads-up displays (HUDs) in combat aircraft cockpits.3 The blanket term mixed reality (MR) is about 25 years old, first appearing in a paper describing a reality–virtuality continuum.4 Today there are a multitude of technologically enhanced “realities.” Although immersive experiences and technologies themselves are not all necessarily new, they now constitute an entire domain with a dynamic landscape of services, vendors, and consumers and a S. D. Simpkins, P. D. Allen, and N. W. DeMatt Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Volume 35, Number 3 (2020), www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest 162 of the field through its current state. The latter part of this article summarizes technical work APL teams are doing within the domain, centered on the primary features and benefits of virtual reality (VR), AR, and MR. We conclude with some practical applications of immersive experiences and technologies, highlighting their utility to APL and its sponsors. TERMINOLOGY AND HISTORY Immersive technology is a vast multidimensional discipline giving rise to a unique lexicon describing various subcategories within the field—VR, AR, MR, blended reality, enhanced reality, augmented virtuality, and others. These terms are vague and often overlap intentionally. Adding to the confusion is the torrent of buzzwords, hype, and marketing from companies (both large and small) looking to make their mark in a nascent multi-billion-dollar industry. In some cases, corporate marketing and branding has claimed exclusivity for specific terms. The industry itself struggles with an onslaught of labels and descriptors for this expansive domain. It can be difficult to determine what one term means for a broad audience (i.e., to differentiate between various “realities”). The term XR emerged to encompass all the subcategories and descriptors. This catchall term is sometimes defined as extended reality and has also been defined as cross reality or {whatever} reality. Expressed with the generic X, this newest term implies a variable boundary with opportunities for any mixture of designed user experiences. We define XR as a broad integration of various applications that extend beyond viewed content to include sensors, wearables, prosthetics, and artificial intelligence. Despite the abundance of terms, immersing users in an enhanced, artificial environment comes down to two methods: (1) present an entirely encompassing view where 100% of the visual range is created or (2) apply enhanced content to the user’s existing visual range. The varying degree to which these methods are applied, or combined, is what keeps adding new terms to the industry’s lexicon. While hardware devices themselves may blend one into another, there are ultimately two key modalities: either the immersive device is taking users to another place (real or imagined) or the device is delivering digital content into users’ physical worlds. These two modalities are complementary, but distinct, and both have a variety of uses in the public, private, and academic sectors. A brief description of the two dominant categories is presented here for clarity. Virtual reality (VR) describes interactions in an entirely artificial, immersive, constructed environment. VR strives to present users an entirely detached environment absent interactions with their physical surroundings or “real world.” VR users often wear HMDs. Monitoring sensors for these systems are generally designed to measure user motion with HMDs so software can present a world consistent with the operator’s senses. A full user experience can involve haptic feedback, with sensors emulating heat, touch, pressure, and wind uniquely tuned to match, and enhance, the wearer’s actions in VR. The more an operator can fully participate in an immersive cognitive experience, the better the experience will be. The highest-quality and best-funded VR applications today are for entertainment, designed to engage users with an artificial environment while they interact with provided content. Examples include applications that immerse users in undersea worlds, within historic battles, or in collaborative work spaces. The gaming industry, realizing the value of immersing users in wellscripted environments, was an early adopter of VR. VR gaming consoles in wide use today had their beginnings in Virtual Boy, Nintendo’s 1995 foray into the immersive environment. If you don’t remember Virtual Boy, you’re not alone; it was on the market, at more than $175, for less than a year but represents the first serious attempt to market VR gaming to the public. Augmented reality (AR) differs from VR in that it relies on the real world as a substrate. AR places computer-generated content in the user’s normal field of view. Professional industries are adopting AR for a variety of design, planning, and educational purposes. Applying these types of overlays requires data availability and processing power driven by quick responsiveness to apply content to users’ immediate surroundings with imperceptible delay. AR hardware takes many forms, including headsets, mobile device applications, and even projection-based CAVEs. (CAVE is a recursive acronym for Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, describing a VR display room—essentially a 10-ft. cube—first developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago. User movement is tracked and VR content projected on the walls of the cube from the outside, allowing users to move freely, unencumbered.) AR examples include AR eyeglasses, games like Pokémon GO for mobile devices, and multiple personal navigation applications. AR vaulted into the public conversation when Google released Google Glass in 2013 and became much more commonplace with improvement in mobile device capabilities. Modern computing, sensing, graphics, and display quality and modalities have pushed immersive devices and applications beyond a single-dimensional categorization to a much broader and diverse multidimensional description of capabilities. The ever-widening spectrum of technology and applications (see Figure 1) has grown to effectively integrate with parallel technology, making immersive applications part of capability suites available to developers, engineers, managers, and enthusiasts alike. Overview of Immersive Technology: Terminology, State of the Art, and APL Efforts Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Volume 35, Number 3 (2020), www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest 163 THE STATE OF XR TODAY Today, VR gaming is everywhere, entry-point pricing is affordable for many, and immersive graphics are superb. Consumers can buy a VR headset in the style of Google Cardboard for $10 or less and, by using free applications for smartphones, enjoy a worthwhile entrylevel VR experience. For a few hundred dollars, systems on the market allow full freedom of movement, highquality user controls, and an untethered experience. The market is filled with early-adopter hardware, like Microsoft’s AR HoloLens, and software marketing mobile AR applications with popular offerings. Diverse professional interests are entering the domain, resulting in services to support marketing, facility visualization, and computer-aided design (CAD), to name just a few. Although using computer simulations for various kinds of professional work is not new, XR today allows designers to view, adjust, and even stand inside of processes. Haptic gloves, vests, and suits add sensory learning, reflex response, and muscle memory to training for hazardous work. Where and how the professional market closes the gap between entertainment and “serious” applications is not fully defined yet, but the growing XR community has recorded familiar successes. Many people have come into contact with XR at museums and exhibits. Curators are early a

How Virtual and Augmented Reality Are Reshaping the Fashion Industry During the Covid-19 Pandemic
User Response to Extended Reality Sponsorship Activations on Social Media: Exploring Impressions of GoPro’s Use of 360° Video in Marketing
Abstract This research explores user impressions of 360° video as a platform for sponsorship activation, seeking to examine consumers’ responses to 360° virtual environments as a form of extended reality (XR) marketing as well as the structural and experiential antecedents to XR’s potential as a vehicle for brand marketing and sponsorship activation. GoPro was selected as a case study for analysis; 25 brand posts on GoPro’s YouTube channel were identified featuring 360° video integration as sponsorship communications, for which all video metadata and user comments were collected using programming software R to access YouTube’s standard application programming interface (API). Coding of the user commentary data subsequently revealed four primary themes, indicative of users’ impressions of 360° video technology. Notably, the study’s findings suggest that effective 360° integrations—alongside positive user experiences and access to the technology—pose tangible benefits to consumers’ attitudes and experiences, and present sponsors with a viable media through which to activate partnerships.

The Utilization of Augmented Reality (AR) Applications as Packaging Design Enhancement
Food packaging functions as a hub because it is commonly recognized by consumers as the primary location from which they able to access the information that is printed on food packaging. Research done in the past suggests, that the information provided about foods is typically murky and difficult to understand. In the most recent trend of technological innovation, those who are in charge of marketing food are being pressured to consider more traditional methods of managing food information. Through the utilization of technology in the innovation of food packaging, it is possible to produce an interactive food package. Currently, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been used as one of the features in packaging design. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study on the incorporation of augmented reality into packaging design. This is to determine the factors that may provide the best user experience. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify packaging design elements that must be considered and to identify the augmented reality (AR) technology utilized in packaging design.

Abstract In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in video capturing devices, which led to large personal and corporate digital video archives. This huge volume of video data became a source of inspiration for the development of vast numbers of applications such as visual surveillance, multimedia recommender systems, and context-aware advertising. The heterogeneity of video data, higher storage, processing cost, and communication requirements demand for a system that can efficiently manage and store huge amount of video data, while providing user-friendly access to stored data at the same time. To address this problem, video summarization schemes have been proposed. Video summarization refers to the extraction of keyframes, identifying most important and pertinent content. For instance, gastroenterologist uses wireless capsule endoscopy video technology to diagnose his patients. However, during capsule endoscopy process, video data are produced in huge amounts, but only a limited amount of data is actually useful for diagnosis. In this talk, we will explore two different aspects of video summarization: visual surveillance and medical imaging. analytics, mining and summarization. significant contribution areas of visual surveillance, information mining and data encryption. He published 90+ papers in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences such as Information Fusion, Neurocomputing, IEEE Access, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, International Journal of Information Management, Future Generation Computer Systems, Sensors, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, Multimedia Tools and Applications, Computers in Human Behaviour, EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing, Mobile Networks and Applications, Computers in Biology and Medicine, Journal of Medical Systems, Signal, Image and Video Processing, Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, NBIS 2015, MITA 2015, PlatCon 2016, SKIMA 2019, and IWFCV 2020. He is serving as a professional for numerous well-reputed journals such as Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, Future Generation Computer Systems, IEEE Access, Journal of Super Computing, Signal Image and Video Processing, Multimedia Tools and Applications, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, and Enterprise Information Systems. He acted as GE/LGE in several special issues of SCI/SCIE indexed journals and is currently involved in editing of several other special issues. Abstract A good data representation can typically reveal the latent structure of data and facilitate further processes such as clustering, classification and recognition. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) as a fundamental approach for data representation has attracted great attentions. Despite its great performance, traditional NMF fails to explore the semantic information of multiple components as well as the diversity among them, which would be of great benefit to understand data comprehensively and in depth. In fact, real data are usually complex and contain various components. For example, face images have ex-pressions and genders. Each component mainly reflects one aspect of data and provides information others do not have. In this talk, I will present an approach on multi-component nonnegative matrix factorization (MCNMF). Instead of seeking only one representation of data, MCNMF learns multiple representations simultaneously, where each representation corresponds to a component. By integrating the multiple representations, a more comprehensive representation is then established.

The study of how XR technologies impact the retail industry, now and in the future
Extended reality (XR) is currently one of the most discussed technologies in the retail sector. While XR applications are presently utilized by a range of retail companies, recent technological developments and societal transformations indicate that these technologies will become a mainstream necessity for success. This paper investigates how XR technologies impact the retail sector, now and in the future. In order to collect substantiated and timely data, this study engages in a multi faceted, qualitative data collection approach including a literature review, attendance at retail conferences and events, and semi-structured interviews with industry experts. Results reveal the implementation of three types of XR technologies are significant contributors to company success: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). They are currently utilized to enhance the customer experience, improve training, conduct consumer behavioral analyses, and develop prototyping for increased efficiency and productivity in product merchandising, packaging and branding. However, implementation of these technologies does not guarantee success. This study indicates success of these applications requires an understanding of each technology’s specific affordances in order to effectively integrate them within particular areas of the retail supply chain. Augmented reality is often best suited for consumer applications, while necessary proprietary equipment makes virtual and mixed reality more effective for industrial and enterprise applications. If utilized effectively, these technologies can help increase sales, make the manufacturing workflow more cost effective and efficient, and create a retail landscape that allows for the synchronous success of both brick and mortar stores and ecommerce. Future XR technologies will look to standardize and simplify, and eventually, there will be a collection of uniform XR experiences that will become conventional, easily integrated, and user friendly. If retailers want to be competitive, both in online and offline shopping, this study emphasizes the need to invest in XR technologies and build flexible tech management teams that prioritize XR as a technological resource, and restructure businesses to easily adapt to the rapidly changing tech landscape.

User Response to Extended Reality Sponsorship Activations on Social Media: Exploring Impressions of GoPro’s Use of 360° Video in Marketing
Abstract This research explores user impressions of 360° video as a platform for sponsorship activation, seeking to examine consumers’ responses to 360° virtual environments as a form of extended reality (XR) marketing as well as the structural and experiential antecedents to XR’s potential as a vehicle for brand marketing and sponsorship activation. GoPro was selected as a case study for analysis; 25 brand posts on GoPro’s YouTube channel were identified featuring 360° video integration as sponsorship communications, for which all video metadata and user comments were collected using programming software R to access YouTube’s standard application programming interface (API). Coding of the user commentary data subsequently revealed four primary themes, indicative of users’ impressions of 360° video technology. Notably, the study’s findings suggest that effective 360° integrations—alongside positive user experiences and access to the technology—pose tangible benefits to consumers’ attitudes and experiences, and present sponsors with a viable media through which to activate partnerships.

The Utilization of Augmented Reality (AR) Applications as Packaging Design Enhancement
Food packaging functions as a hub because it is commonly recognized by consumers as the primary location from which they able to access the information that is printed on food packaging. Research done in the past suggests, that the information provided about foods is typically murky and difficult to understand. In the most recent trend of technological innovation, those who are in charge of marketing food are being pressured to consider more traditional methods of managing food information. Through the utilization of technology in the innovation of food packaging, it is possible to produce an interactive food package. Currently, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been used as one of the features in packaging design. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study on the incorporation of augmented reality into packaging design. This is to determine the factors that may provide the best user experience. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify packaging design elements that must be considered and to identify the augmented reality (AR) technology utilized in packaging design.

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Technologies for Accessibility and Marketing in the Tourism Industry
The study investigated the roles of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for accessibility and marketing in tourism. Literature is reviewed in this exploratory study and examples of VR and AR for accessibility and marketing in the tourism industry are presented. The review was conducted with two perspectives: accessibility role and marketing role of VR and AR technologies in the tourism industry. As a result of reviewing, these technologies have both strengths and weaknesses for accessibility in tourism. VR has both strengths such as a secure environment, alternative access, and weaknesses such as user neglect, high cost. Similarly, AR has both strengths such as knowledge enrichment, enhancement of experience, and weaknesses such as high cost, lack of security. The high cost of both technologies restricts accessibility and marketing. Also, VR and AR have benefits as reducing strategy costs, attracting tourists with gamification strategies, ease of brand promotion, building brand loyalty, collecting data, and customized product development in tourism marketing.

Realizing consumers’ existential dreams via product marketing and mixed reality: a perspective based on affective neuroscience theories
In an era of swift societal changes and escalating consumerism, this paper presents an exploration of an innovative approach that integrates product marketing strategies, mixed reality (MR) technology, and affective neuroscience theories to actualize consumers’ existential dreams. MR, with its unique capacity to blend the virtual and real worlds, can enhance the consumer experience by creating immersive, personalized environments that resonate with consumers’ existential aspirations. Insights from affective neuroscience, specifically the brain’s processing of emotions, guide the development of emotionally engaging marketing strategies, which strengthen the connection between consumers, products, and brands. These integrated strategies not only present a novel blueprint for companies to deepen consumer engagement but also promise more fulfilling and meaningful consumer experiences. Moreover, this approach contributes to societal well-being and prosperity, marking a significant stride in the field of marketing.

Abstract In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in video capturing devices, which led to large personal and corporate digital video archives. This huge volume of video data became a source of inspiration for the development of vast numbers of applications such as visual surveillance, multimedia recommender systems, and context-aware advertising. The heterogeneity of video data, higher storage, processing cost, and communication requirements demand for a system that can efficiently manage and store huge amount of video data, while providing user-friendly access to stored data at the same time. To address this problem, video summarization schemes have been proposed. Video summarization refers to the extraction of keyframes, identifying most important and pertinent content. For instance, gastroenterologist uses wireless capsule endoscopy video technology to diagnose his patients. However, during capsule endoscopy process, video data are produced in huge amounts, but only a limited amount of data is actually useful for diagnosis. In this talk, we will explore two different aspects of video summarization: visual surveillance and medical imaging. analytics, mining and summarization. significant contribution areas of visual surveillance, information mining and data encryption.

He is serving as a professional for numerous well-reputed journals such as Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, Future Generation Computer Systems, IEEE Access, Journal of Super Computing, Signal Image and Video Processing, Multimedia Tools and Applications, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, and Enterprise Information Systems. He acted as GE/LGE in several special issues of SCI/SCIE indexed journals and is currently involved in editing of several other special issues. Abstract A good data representation can typically reveal the latent structure of data and facilitate further processes such as clustering, classification and recognition. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) as a fundamental approach for data representation has attracted great attentions. Despite its great performance, traditional NMF fails to explore the semantic information of multiple components as well as the diversity among them, which would be of great benefit to understand data comprehensively and in depth. In fact, real data are usually complex and contain various components. For example, face images have ex-pressions and genders. Each component mainly reflects one aspect of data and provides information others do not have. In this talk, I will present an approach on multi-component nonnegative matrix factorization (MCNMF). Instead of seeking only one representation of data, MCNMF learns multiple representations simultaneously, where each representation corresponds to a component. By integrating the multiple representations, a more comprehensive representation is then established.

Immersive Technology as a Social Marketing Tool: Exploring the Impact of 360-Video & Virtual Reality on Intent to Help and Attitudes Toward the Homeless
Background Immersive technology holds significant promise for social marketers, but much remains unknown about how best to incorporate these materials into campaigns. To clarify the value of virtual reality and 360-degree video to social marketing, we focused on the impact of media modality on behaviors and attitudes toward the homeless. Focus of the Article This article explores the suitability of immersive technology in social marketing campaigns by comparing how four media modalities [Text & Photos, 2D Video, interactive 360-degree Video, and Virtual Reality (VR)], as well an interactive 360-degree Video control group, impact participants’ intent to help and attitudes toward the homeless. The modalities vary by level of immersiveness, which we characterize based on three dimensions: physicality, vividness, and interactivity. Findings show that VR can change attitudes and behaviors and could be used to increase donations, support for societal initiatives to address homelessness, and other helpful behaviors. Hypotheses H1: The greater the level of media immersiveness, the more positively behavioral intentions toward the homeless are affected. H2: The greater the level of media immersiveness, the more positively attitudes toward the homeless are affected. Importance to the Social Marketing Field Virtual reality seems to hold particular promise in influencing audience attitudes and behavioral intentions. Social marketers need to understand the strategic value of VR as an emerging technology within the context of broader marketing campaigns. VR’s potential to create an immersive media experience positions it as a strategic tool for social marketers to impact target markets and stakeholders. Methods We used a pretest and post-test experimental method focused on first-person narratives of homelessness. An 11-item ATHI Short-Form scale was used to measure attitudes toward the homeless, and selected items from the Experience with Homelessness Scale were used to measure ‘intent to help’ homeless individuals. After a pretest, 461 participants were assigned to one of five treatment conditions: Text & Photos, 2D Video, 360-degree Video, and VR Headset Video, as well a 360-degree Video control group. Results In the VR condition, both ‘intent to help’ and Societal Causation, a subcomponent of attitudes toward the homeless, were significantly higher (p < .05) than all other conditions. The mean intent to help score for the VR condition was 36.05 (out of 55), compared to 32.25 for the next-highest condition. These results indicate that VR may be a viable tool for social marketers to enact positive change among targeted stakeholders. Recommendations for Research or Practice Our findings show how technology can be used as a force for social change. VR demonstrates the potential to foster public support by building a bridge connecting those experiencing homelessness with those who have the desire to help. As such, we recommend the use of homeless stories using VR technology in social marketing campaigns to be employed for small groups of people such as those gathered in educational settings and at donor fundraising events.
